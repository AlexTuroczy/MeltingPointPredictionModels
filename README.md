# MeltingPointPredictionModels
In this repository, we build models for the "Thermophysical Property: Melting Point" kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/melting-point). We attempt to predict the melting pound of compounds based on some physical/chemical attributes, including the molecular structure.
